# ✅ Render Build Error - FIXED

## 🚨 Problem: "vite: not found" Error

**Error Message:**
```
sh: 1: vite: not found
==> Build failed 😞
```

### Root Cause
Render doesn't install `devDependencies` by default in production builds. Your build command (`vite build && esbuild ...`) requires packages that were in `devDependencies`, causing the build to fail.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### What Was Fixed
Moved all **build-critical packages** from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`:

- ✅ `vite` - Frontend build tool
- ✅ `esbuild` - Backend bundler  
- ✅ `@vitejs/plugin-react` - Vite React plugin
- ✅ `tailwindcss` - CSS framework
- ✅ `@tailwindcss/vite` - Tailwind Vite plugin
- ✅ `autoprefixer` - CSS processing
- ✅ `postcss` - CSS processing
- ✅ `typescript` - TypeScript compiler
- ✅ `tsx` - TypeScript execution

### Why This Works
Render installs `dependencies` in production but skips `devDependencies` by default. By moving build tools to `dependencies`, Render can now find and use them during the build process.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Commit and Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Render build: Move build tools to dependencies"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Render Will Auto-Deploy
- Render automatically deploys when you push to `main` branch
- The build should now succeed ✅
- Watch the logs in Render dashboard to confirm

### 3. If Manual Deploy Needed
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click your service (treasure-home-backend)
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

### Check Backend Health
```bash
curl https://treasure-home-backend.onrender.com/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

### Check Render Logs
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. Click **"Logs"** tab
3. Look for:
   ```
   serving on port 10000
   ✅ Database migrations completed successfully
   ✅ Supabase Storage initialization complete
   ```

## 🎯 Common Build Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build still fails with different error
**Solution:**
1. Check Render logs for the specific error
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Try clearing Render's build cache:
   - Settings → Build & Deploy → Clear build cache

### Issue: Database migration fails
**Solution:**
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct in Render env vars
2. Check database allows connections from Render IPs
3. For Supabase: Enable connection pooling in Settings

### Issue: Memory/timeout during build
**Solution:**
1. The free tier has limited resources
2. Consider upgrading to a paid plan for faster builds
3. Or reduce bundle size by removing unused packages

## 📝 Summary

**Problem:** Render couldn't find `vite` during build because it was in `devDependencies`

**Solution:** Moved build tools to `dependencies`

**Result:** Render will now successfully build and deploy your app ✅
