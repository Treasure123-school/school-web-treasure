THS Smart Profile Onboarding System

(To be added under Chapter 1 — “Roles, Login, and Provisioning”)

🎯 Purpose

To ensure that every approved staff or user (Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent) completes their personal profile immediately after first login — before gaining full dashboard access.
This creates a standardized data record and saves the Admin from manually entering every detail.

🧩 How It Works — Step-by-Step

1. Admin Approval Triggers Profile Activation

Once an account (Teacher, Student, or Parent) is approved/verified by the Admin:

The system updates their status to Active.

But their profile_completion flag remains false until they fill the onboarding form.


2. First Login Redirect

When a user logs in for the first time (or any time their profile is incomplete):

Instead of loading the main dashboard, they’re redirected to the Profile Setup Page.

A message appears:

> “👋 Welcome to Treasure-Home School Portal! Please complete your profile to unlock your dashboard.”




3. Smart Multi-Step Form (Modern UI)

To make the experience smooth and engaging, the onboarding form should be a multi-step modern form, not a boring single-page dump.
Here’s how it should look and feel:

Step 1 — Personal Info

Fields:

Full Name (pre-filled from invite)

Gender

Date of Birth

Profile Photo Upload
(Auto-resized to maintain uniform display across dashboards.)


Step 2 — Contact Info

Fields:

Email (read-only)

Phone Number

Address

State / Country


Step 3 — Role-Specific Details

If Teacher: Subject(s), Class(es), Qualification, Years of Experience.

If Admin: Department, Role Description, Access Level.

If Student: Class, Admission Number (auto-filled), Guardian Name.

If Parent: Linked Student(s), Occupation, Contact Preference.


Step 4 — Security Setup

Encourage responsible login habits:

Add a security question (for password recovery)

Set a PIN or 2FA option (if implemented later)

Checkbox for “I agree to the THS Data Policy.”


Step 5 — Preview & Submit

Show all entered details for confirmation.

Once submitted, a toast notification says:

> “🎉 Profile completed successfully! Redirecting you to your dashboard…”

🧠 Key Functional Logic

Event	System Behavior

profile_completion = false	Redirect to onboarding page
profile_completion = true	Direct dashboard access
Form auto-saves	Every step auto-saves progress in case of refresh
Editable later	After submission, user can edit only non-critical fields (Admin can unlock full edit rights)

💡 Extra Smart Features (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. AI Autofill Suggestion: Auto-suggest missing fields based on email domain (e.g. school.edu.ng → pre-fill department).


2. Parent–Child Sync: When a parent updates address or contact info, linked student record updates automatically.
