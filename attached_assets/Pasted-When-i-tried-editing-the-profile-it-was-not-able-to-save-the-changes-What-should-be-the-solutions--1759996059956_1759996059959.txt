It looks like you're having trouble saving profile changes, indicated by the "Update Failed: Failed to fetch" error message. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as network issues, API endpoint issues, or even CORS configuration problems. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

Check API Endpoint: Ensure that the API you are trying to hit for updating the profile is correctly set up in your client code. For example, inspect the fetch request in your handleSave function in the TeacherProfile.tsx file:

const response = await fetch(`/api/profile/${user.id}`, { // Ensure this URL is correct
    method: 'PATCH',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    credentials: 'include',
    body: JSON.stringify(profileData)
});
Make sure that  matches your backend setup.

Network Issues: Confirm that your network is stable and that you can reach the server. You can test this by opening the network tab in developer tools and checking for failed requests.

Server Logs: Check the server logs for any errors when the request comes in. This could give you more information on why the request is failing.

CORS Issues: If you're running the front end and back end on different ports, ensure that your server allows cross-origin requests from your front end. You might need to add CORS middleware to your server.

Check Data Being Sent: Ensure that profileData is correctly structured and contains all the required fields before sending it in the request body.

Error Handling in API: Review your server-side code where you handle the update request to ensure proper error handling and response messages are in place. For example, make sure your error handling logic is robust in the API, as seen in routes.ts:

res.status(500).json({ message: "Failed to update profile" });
Debugging: Consider adding more extensive logging in the client side to verify what data is being sent and received.

Following these steps should help you diagnose and potentially resolve the issue. If you need help with specific parts of the code, feel free to ask!

To identify and fix the issues with your  code related to the "Update Failed: Failed to fetch" error, let’s focus on the fetch calls in your profile update mutation. Here's a consolidated view of where the potential issues may exist.

Suggested Fixes
Update fetch URL: Make sure the endpoint is correct. Instead of "/api/profile/me", ensure your API is set up properly in your routing files and use the right endpoint.

Error Handling: Improve the error handling to log more details if fetching fails.

Ensure CORS is handled: If your frontend and backend are on different servers or ports, ensure that you allow CORS.

Check Payload Structure: Make sure that the payload sent is formatted correctly.

Here’s a complete example of how your  might look after addressing these issues:

import { useMutation } from 'react-query';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { toast } from 'react-toastify';
const ProfileOnboarding = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  
  const updateProfileMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (data: OnboardingFormData) => {
      const payload = {
        personalInfo: {
          firstName: data.firstName,
          lastName: data.lastName,
          dateOfBirth: data.dateOfBirth,
          gender: data.gender,
        },
        contactInfo: {
          phone: data.phone,
          address: data.address,
          state: data.state,
          country: data.country,
        },
        roleSpecific: getRoleSpecificData(data),
        security: {
          securityQuestion: data.securityQuestion,
          securityAnswer: data.securityAnswer,
          dataPolicyAgreed: data.dataPolicyAgreed,
        },
      };
      const response = await fetch("/api/profile/me", {
        method: "PUT",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        credentials: "include",
        body: JSON.stringify(payload),
      });
      if (!response.ok) {
        const error = await response.json();
        console.error('Error on profile update:', error); // Log error details
        throw new Error(error.message || "Failed to update profile");
      }
      return response.json(); // Return the response data
    },
    onSuccess: (data: any) => {
      // Handle success, maybe redirect or show notification
      toast({
        title: "Profile Updated",
        description: `Your profile is ${data.completionPercentage}% complete!`,
      });
      // Redirect based on user role
      navigate("/portal/teacher"); // Adjust navigation as needed
    },
    onError: (error: Error) => {
      toast({
        title: "Error",
        description: error.message || "Failed to update profile",
        variant: "destructive",
      });
    }
  });
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form elements go here */}
      <button type="submit" disabled={updateProfileMutation.isPending}>
        {updateProfileMutation.isPending ? "Saving..." : "Save Profile"}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
};
export default ProfileOnboarding;
Additional Checks
Ensure your backend API is running and accessible from the frontend.
Verify that your server is set up to handle CORS, allowing requests from your frontend's origin.
Ensure you are not facing any network issues by testing the API endpoint directly in your browser or using tools like Postman.
Following these adjustments should improve both your error handling and the overall reliability of the profile updating process. If you continue to experience issues, further debugging on the server side and checking logs will be necessary.
