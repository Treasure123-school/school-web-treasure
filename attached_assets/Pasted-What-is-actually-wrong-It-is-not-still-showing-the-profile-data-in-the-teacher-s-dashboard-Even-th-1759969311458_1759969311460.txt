From your description, it seems that the profile data is not being displayed correctly in the Teacher Dashboard, despite having been set up. Here are a few things to check based on your code:

Profile Data Loading Condition: Ensure that the profile data is being loaded correctly. Look at the useQuery for the teacher profile and check if the API is returning the expected data:

const { data: profileStatus, isLoading: statusLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['/api/teacher/profile/status'],
    queryFn: async () => {
        const response = await apiRequest('GET', '/api/teacher/profile/status');
        return await response.json();
    },
    enabled: !!user
});
Confirm that the API endpoint /api/teacher/profile/status is returning the correct data structure.

Ensure Data Exists: Verify that the teacher profile exists and has the necessary fields populated. Check if the profile data is correctly fetched and accessible in the component.

State Handling: Check if the state that holds the fetched profile data (like teacherProfile) is being updated correctly in your UI.

Rendering Logic: Ensure that the rendering logic checks for the presence of the profile data before trying to display it. You might be rendering the UI before the profile data is fetched.

Console Logging: Utilize console logging as shown in your codebase to track what data is returned:

useEffect(() => {
    if (teacherProfile) {
        console.log('ðŸ“‹ TeacherProfile data structure:', {
            department: teacherProfile.department,
            subjects: teacherProfile.subjects,
            assignedClasses: teacherProfile.assignedClasses,
            fullProfile: teacherProfile
        });
    }
}, [teacherProfile]);
Frontend and Backend Connection: Ensure that your frontend is correctly communicating with the backend APIs. Check if any errors are logged in the console or in the network tab of the browser's developer tools.

Check these points to troubleshoot and identify why the profile data is not showing on the Teacher Dashboard. If you've confirmed everything is set up correctly but the issue persists, consider reviewing the API responses and whether there are network issues affecting the data retrieval.
