THS Story Plan — Chapter One: The Gatekeepers of Access
Page 1 – The Foundation of Security
In the world of Treasure-Home School (THS), every digital door has a lock, and every lock has a key.
But not all keys are the same.
• Admins hold the master keys.
• Teachers hold keys that open classrooms.
• Students hold keys that open learning halls.
• Parents hold keys that open observation windows.
But here is the golden rule: no one may enter a hall they don’t belong to.
And the system itself is the gatekeeper.
Page 2 – How Users Sign In
Every role has its own entrance path:
• Students & Parents:
• Enter their username + password.
• Example username: THS-STU-2025-PR3-001
• If details are correct → door opens.
• If incorrect → system says, 
❌ “Invalid login. Please check your username or password.”
• If suspended → system says, 
🚫 “Your account is suspended. Contact your class teacher or Admin.”
• Teachers & Admins:
• Must use their real Google email.
• On first sign-in, their account is marked Pending Approval.
• If they try to log in before approval, system says: 
⏳ “Welcome to THS Portal. Your account is awaiting Admin approval. You will be notified once verified.”
• If Admin later approves → login works.
• If Admin suspends → login blocked, with message: 
🚫 “Access denied: Your account has been suspended by THS Admin.”

The Admin dashboard is the control tower. From here, the Admin can:
• See all Pending Teachers/Admins waiting for approval.
• Approve → Status changes to Active.
• Suspend → Status changes to Suspended.
• Revoke approval → Status changes back to Pending.
Whenever Admin acts, the system ensures that users see the right message when they try to log in.
Page 4 – Why Clear Messages Matter
THS must never confuse its community with vague “Sign-in failed.”
Instead, every message must speak clearly to the user’s real situation:
• Invalid credentials:
❌ “Invalid login. Please check your details and try again.”
• Pending approval:
⏳ “Your account is awaiting Admin approval. Contact your school administrator.”
• Suspended:
🚫 “Your account is suspended. Please contact the Admin for support.”
• Active and valid:
✅ “Welcome back to THS Portal. Redirecting you to your dashboard…”
These messages make the system feel professional, fair, and trustworthy.
Page 5 – Parent–Child Linking
When Admin imports student data, parents are linked automatically.
If a parent logs in, the system says:
👨‍👩‍👧 “Welcome, Parent. Please select the child whose records you wish to view.”
Parents never see other students’ data. The system keeps boundaries strict.

• Students & Parents log in with username + password.
• Teachers & Admins log in with Google → account enters Pending Approval.
• Admin approves → status becomes Active.
• Suspended users are blocked with clear reasons.
• Every login attempt has a polished, role-specific message.
Page 7 – The Promise
At the end of Chapter One, THS has built a secure, respectful, and transparent entry system.
No one is left guessing.

• Every role has a dedicated entrance path.
• Admin acts as the gatekeeper for Teachers/Admins.
