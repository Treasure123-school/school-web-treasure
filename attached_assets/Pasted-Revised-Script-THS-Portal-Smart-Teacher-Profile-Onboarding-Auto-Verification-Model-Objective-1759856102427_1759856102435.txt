Revised Script — THS Portal: Smart Teacher Profile Onboarding (Auto Verification Model)
🧭 Objective
To streamline the teacher onboarding process by allowing first-time teachers to complete a mandatory digital profile form, which once successfully submitted, automatically verifies and unlocks their dashboard — while still keeping admin visibility and system logs for accountability.
🧱 Core Principles
• Automation with Oversight – The system auto-verifies once all required data is valid and complete.
• Frictionless Experience – Teachers move from onboarding → teaching tools in one smooth flow.
• Accountability via Visibility – Admins can still view, edit, or suspend any teacher profile at any time.
• Data-Driven Dashboard Initialization – The completed form configures what appears in the teacher’s dashboard (subjects, students, analytics).
🧩 Process Flow
🔹 Step 1 — First Login Trigger
if teacher.first_login: redirect_to('teacher_setup_form') else: redirect_to('teacher_dashboard') 
Upon first login, the system locks the teacher out of all dashboards until their setup form is completed.
🔹 Step 2 — The Teacher Setup Form
Page Title:
Welcome, [Teacher Name]! Let’s personalize your portal.
Sections:
• Personal Information
• Name (auto-filled)
• Gender
• Contact info (editable)
• Date of Birth
• Professional Information
• Qualification
• Subject(s)
• Class(es)
• Department
• Years of Experience
• System Settings
• Grading Mode (100/Continuous)
• Notification Preference (Email, In-App)
• Signature Upload
• Profile Photo
• Policy Agreement
• Checkbox: “I confirm the accuracy of my information and agree to the school’s data policy.”
🔹 Step 3 — Smart Auto Verification Logic
Once the teacher submits the form:
if form.is_valid(): save_teacher_profile() teacher.first_login = False teacher.status = "Verified" log_activity(teacher.id, "Auto-verified after form completion") redirect_to('teacher_dashboard') notify_admin_of_auto_verification(teacher.id) else: show_error("Please complete all required fields.") 
✅ Outcome:
• Profile is automatically marked as Verified.
• System grants instant access to the teacher dashboard.
• A notification alert is sent to the Admin (in-app + email).
• Admin can still review, suspend, or edit any teacher later.
💡 New Feature Ideas (Enhancing Your Version)
🧠 1. Profile Completeness Meter
• A visual tracker shows completion percentage before allowing submission.
• Example: 
“Profile 85% complete. Please upload your digital signature to continue.”
This ensures data quality and full record coverage.
🔐 2. Auto Role Setup
• When the form is submitted, the system automatically assigns: 
• Relevant subject dashboards
• Linked students
• Class data for scoring and report entry
This removes manual setup from admin.
🧾 3. Audit Log & Notification
Each auto-verification creates a record in admin logs:
ActionUserTimestampStatusTeacher profile auto-verifiedMr. Femi Adewale2025-10-07 14:35Success 
Admins get this summary on their dashboard:
“1 new teacher profile auto-verified today. Review for approval if needed.”
🖥️ 4. Teacher Dashboard Personalization
Upon successful verification:
• The teacher dashboard greets them dynamically: 
“Welcome, Mr. Adewale! You’re assigned to JSS1A & JSS2B (Mathematics).”
• Widgets are personalized to show: 
• Upcoming exams for assigned classes
• Students performance overview
• Quick access to mark input and reports
🧑‍🏫 5. Admin Dashboard View Update
In the Admin panel:
TeacherSubject(s)ClassesDepartmentStatusDate JoinedMr. Femi AdewaleMathematicsJSS1A, JSS2BScience✅ Auto-Verified07-Oct-2025 
Admin can:
• Suspend teacher if irregularities occur
• Edit any detail
• Send a message or reassign classes instantly
🔍 6. Fail-Safe Validation
Even with auto-verification, you can include a “trust check” layer:
• If suspicious or incomplete data is detected (e.g., missing subject), the system flags it: 
“Profile pending admin confirmation – incomplete subject assignment.”
This keeps automation safe and intelligent.
