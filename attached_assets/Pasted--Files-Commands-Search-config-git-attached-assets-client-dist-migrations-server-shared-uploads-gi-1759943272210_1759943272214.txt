Based on the error logs and screenshots, I can identify all the issues preventing teacher profile creation and setup. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
1. DATABASE SCHEMA MISMATCH - MISSING TABLES ‚ùå
Error: relation "admin_profiles" does not exist

What's Happening:

The code tries to delete from admin_profiles, teacher_profiles, and parent_profiles tables
These tables DO NOT EXIST in your database
Migration  was never executed
What Will Happen:

Profile creation fails with TypeError or database errors
User deletion cascades fail (affects data integrity)
Teacher profile setup cannot proceed
2. PROFILE SETUP REDIRECT LOOP üîÑ
Error: Dashboard shows 0% profile completion but no redirect

What's Happening:

 checks 
If false, should redirect to /portal/teacher/profile-setup
BUT the redirect is not triggering despite hasProfile: false
What Will Happen:

Teachers see empty dashboard with 0% completion
No automatic redirect to setup form
Users stuck in limbo state
3. FAILED FETCH ERRORS ‚ö†Ô∏è
Error: "Profile Creation Failed - Failed to fetch"

What's Happening:

Form submission to /api/teacher/profile/setup fails
Backend returns 500 error due to missing tables
Frontend shows generic "Failed to fetch" message
What Will Happen:

All teacher profile submissions fail
No profiles get created
Auto-verification never triggers
4. STAFF ID UNIQUENESS CONSTRAINT VIOLATION üö´
Potential Issue: (from code analysis in rag://rag_source_0)

What's Happening:

Code checks for existing staffId but table doesn't exist
Auto-generation logic (THS/TCH/YYYY/XXX) fails silently
Empty string staffId may violate UNIQUE constraint
What Will Happen:

Duplicate staff ID errors (if table exists)
NULL constraint violations
Profile creation blocked
5. MISSING PROFILE DATA PERSISTENCE üíæ
From Screenshots:

Profile shows "Staff ID: N/A"
Missing: Qualification, Department, Subjects, Classes
0% completion despite having basic user data
What's Happening:

teacher_profiles table doesn't exist to store data
Profile completion calculation returns 0%
Dashboard can't display professional info
What Will Happen:

No teacher metadata stored
Dashboard shows incomplete profile permanently
Teachers cannot access full functionality
6. VERIFICATION WORKFLOW BLOCKED ‚è∏Ô∏è
From Admin Dashboard Screenshot:

Shows "1 Teacher Profile Auto-Verified Today!"
But profile doesn't actually exist in database
What's Happening:

Auto-verification email sent to admin
But teacher_profiles table missing means no verification record
verified flag cannot be set
What Will Happen:

Verification workflow broken
Admins see false success notifications
Teachers never gain verified status
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
PRIMARY FAILURE POINT:
-- This migration was NEVER executed:
migrations/0012_add_teacher_profiles.sql
Evidence from logs:

PostgresError: relation "admin_profiles" does not exist
PostgresError: relation "teacher_profiles" does not exist
CASCADING FAILURES:
‚ùå Missing tables ‚Üí Profile creation fails
‚ùå Profile creation fails ‚Üí Redirect logic doesn't trigger
‚ùå No redirect ‚Üí Teacher stuck on broken dashboard
‚ùå Dashboard shows 0% ‚Üí No guidance to fix issue
‚ùå Failed submissions ‚Üí Generic error messages
‚ùå No profiles ‚Üí Verification workflow broken
IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED
**Fix 1: Run Missing Migration
**

**Fix 2: Verify Tables Exist
**

*Fix 3: Update Profile Setup Redirect Logic
client/src/pages/portal/TeacherDashboard.tsx
Fix redirect logic to always trigger when profile is missing
*Fix 4: Enhanced Error Handling in Profile Setup
client/src/pages/portal/TeacherProfileSetup.tsx
Add detailed error logging and user feedback
SUMMARY - WHAT HAS HAPPENED & WHAT WILL HAPPEN
‚úÖ WHAT HAS HAPPENED (Current State):
‚ùå Database migrations incomplete - profile tables missing
‚ùå Teacher profile creation endpoint fails with 500 errors
‚ùå Dashboard redirect logic not triggering properly
‚ùå Profile completion stuck at 0% permanently
‚ùå Generic "Failed to fetch" errors hiding real issues
‚ùå Verification workflow partially broken
üîß WHAT WILL HAPPEN (After Fixes):
‚úÖ Database tables created via migration push
‚úÖ Profile creation succeeds with proper validation
‚úÖ Dashboard redirect forces navigation to setup form
‚úÖ Profile completion calculates correctly
‚úÖ Detailed error messages guide users to solutions
‚úÖ Auto-verification workflow completes successfully
üìã ACTION ITEMS (In Order):
RUN MIGRATION IMMEDIATELY - Execute npm run db:push
VERIFY DATABASE - Check tables exist with psql command
APPLY CODE FIXES - Update redirect and error handling
TEST FULL FLOW - Create new teacher profile end-to-end
MONITOR LOGS - Ensure no new errors appear
