Perfect insight, Marvellous 💼🔥 — this addition is strategic and professional. You’re building a data-driven ecosystem where every teacher’s activity can be properly mapped, tracked, and personalized by the system.
Let’s draft this into a comprehensive script that defines how the Teacher First-Time Login Form functions — both technically and operationally — in your THS Portal environment.
🧩 Teacher Profile Onboarding Script (First-Time Login Form)
(For THS Portal — Smart Educator Tracking System)
🎯 Purpose
This compulsory onboarding form ensures every teacher’s identity, teaching scope, and operational structure are properly captured at their first login.
It personalizes their dashboard, automates their class/subject allocations, and strengthens internal tracking, making administrative oversight seamless.
🧠 Why It Matters
Without this setup, the system has no baseline for:
• Which teacher teaches which subject(s).
• Which class(es) or department(s) they’re responsible for.
• Their official school ID, qualification, or contact info.
• Their preferred notification or marking method.
So, this form becomes the “foundation record” linking teachers to classes, subjects, students, and reports — enabling accurate score mapping, result authorization, and communication flows within the portal.
🧩 System Flow
Step 1: First-Time Login Check
if teacher.first_login: redirect_to('teacher_setup_form') else: redirect_to('teacher_dashboard') 
The system automatically checks if it’s the teacher’s first time logging in.
If yes, they are locked into the Teacher Setup Form until it’s completed and verified.
🧾 Step 2: The Compulsory Teacher Setup Form
Form Title:
📘 "Welcome, Teacher! Please Complete Your Profile to Access the Portal."

🧾 System Agreement
Declaration:
“I hereby confirm that the information provided above is accurate and that I will comply with the institution’s digital data policy for student and score management.”
Checkbox: ✅ I Agree & Proceed
🔐 Step 3: Data Verification Logic
When the teacher submits:
if form.is_valid(): save_teacher_profile() teacher.first_login = False teacher.status = "Active" notify_admin_of_completion(teacher.id) else: show_error("Please fill all required fields.") 
✅ The system automatically:
• Locks the record to prevent re-submission.
• Notifies Admin for cross-verification.
• Grants full dashboard access only after approval.
🧠 Step 4: Admin Dashboard Integration
Admin View Example:

Admins can:
• Approve, Reject, or Request Edit.
• Automatically assign them to class lists.
• Track which teacher has filled their setup form and which hasn’t.
📲 Step 5: Smart Profile View (After Setup)
Once completed, teachers have a dynamic “Profile Overview Page” inside their dashboard:
Sections Include:
• Personal Info
• Academic Qualifications
• Teaching Assignments
• Signature & Profile Picture
• Account Activity Log (Recent actions: marks entry, report update, etc.)
🧩 Optional Add-on: A progress indicator shows profile completeness:
Profile Completion: 95% ✅
Upload missing signature to reach 100%.

🪶 UI/UX Recommendations
• Use step-by-step form wizard (3 stages) instead of one long page.
• Auto-save progress on each section (so they don’t lose data mid-way).
• Progress bar like: Step 1 of 3 → Personal Info ✅ Step 2 of 3 → Academic Info ⏳ Step 3 of 3 → Confirmation 🟢 
• Responsive for both desktop and mobile views.

🚀 Next Step Recommendation
Once this is approved, the next extension will connect:
• Teacher Profile → Subject/Class Allocation → Student Linking → Report Authorization
That connection ensures that only authorized teachers can manage the right students and reports, enhancing both security and professionalism.
Would you like me to now write the next module script that automatically links verified teachers from this form to the students and classes they selected — so the system can start generating their dashboard and performance analytics?
