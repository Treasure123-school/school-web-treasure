THS Story Plan — Chapter One (Extended: Admin Powers)
Page 8 – The Admin’s Control Panel
Inside THS, the Admin is not just a user — the Admin is the guardian of the gates.
That means they need full control over who comes in, who stays in, and who must be removed.
The Admin dashboard should therefore support the following status levels and actions for every user:
1. Verified vs Unverified
• Unverified: Default status for all new Google sign-ins (Teachers & Admins). 
• They cannot access the dashboard until Admin reviews.
• Message to user: 
⏳ “Your account is pending verification. Please wait for Admin approval.”
• Verified: Admin approves, user gets access immediately. 
• System marks them as Trusted.
2. Suspend vs Unsuspend
• Suspend: Admin can block a user without deleting them. 
• User tries to log in → 
🚫 “Your account has been suspended. Contact Admin for assistance.”
• Unsuspend: Restores account access.
This is useful for temporary issues (discipline, misuse, etc.) without losing user records.
3. Delete Account
• Removes the account completely.
• System logs this action in an Audit Trail (record of Admin actions).
• A warning confirms before deletion: 
⚠️ “Are you sure? Deleting this account is permanent and cannot be undone.”
4. Reset Password / Force Password Change
• Admin can generate a new password for students or parents.
• Option to enforce: “Next login must change password.”
5. Role Management
• Admin can upgrade or downgrade roles (e.g., a teacher promoted to senior admin, or revoked back).
• Every role change is tracked.
6. Audit Logs (Optional, but Professional)
• Every admin action (approve, suspend, delete, reset password) should be recorded with: 
• Admin name
• Date/time
• Action taken
• Affected account
This ensures accountability inside the system itself.
7. Security Alerts (Optional, but Future-Ready)
• If a suspicious login attempt happens (wrong password too many times, login from new device, etc.), Admin can get a notification.
Page 9 – Why These Controls Matter
• Verified/Unverified → Prevents strangers from posing as Teachers/Admins.
• Suspend/Unsuspend → Gives Admin flexibility without losing data.
• Delete → Ensures permanent removal if needed.
• Reset Password → Helps Students/Parents who forget their credentials.
• Role Management → Keeps the structure dynamic but controlled.
• Audit Logs → Builds trust and transparency.
• Security Alerts → Raises system credibility to a professional level.

With these powers, the Admin is not only a manager but also a protector of the system’s integrity.
The portal becomes:
• Safe (no intruders).
• Transparent (clear user messages).
• Flexible (temporary suspension vs permanent deletion).
• Professional (audit logs + structured verification).
At the end of this chapter, THS has a login and admin control system that mirrors the best practices of real educational technology platforms.
