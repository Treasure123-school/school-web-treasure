Based on the information you've provided, here are the current issues that may be causing the profile creation to fail and preventing the setup profile data from showing on the dashboard:

Current Problems
Network Error:

You received a notification indicating a "Network error - cannot connect to server." This suggests that there might be an issue with the server being down or unreachable. Make sure the server is running properly and verify your internet connection.
Submission Errors:

The problem may arise due to missing required fields in the profile submission. Make sure that all mandatory fields are filled out as specified in the profile creation logic ().
Error Handling:

The error handling in the profile submission process may not provide enough feedback to indicate what caused the failure. Review the existing error handling in the server routes (e.g., in the  for profile submission) to ensure detailed error messages are captured and returned to the frontend.
Server Configuration:

If the server itself is not properly configured (e.g., binding to the correct address or port), it could prevent the application from functioning correctly. Ensure that your server is set up to listen on 0.0.0.0 and the correct port (e.g., 5000 for web applications).
Database Constraints:

If there are constraints defined in the database schema (e.g., unique constraints for certain fields), ensure that the data being submitted does not violate these constraints. Refer to the migration scripts () for schema definitions.
Troubleshooting Steps
Check Server Status: Verify that the server hosting your backend is up and running.
Inspect Console Logs: Use the browser's developer tools to check for any error messages in the console related to network requests.
Validate Input Data: Double-check that all necessary fields are filled in on the profile creation form.
Review Server Logs: Look into the server logs for any detailed error messages when a submission attempt is made.
Make sure to address these issues step-by-step to diagnose the specific cause of the problems you are facing. If further assistance is needed in any particular area, please let me know!
