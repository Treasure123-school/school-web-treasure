**ROOT CAUSE:**
The auto-scoring system in server/routes.ts uses a hardcoded system UUID `'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'` for the `recorded_by` field when saving exam results, but this UUID doesn't exist in the users table, causing every auto-scoring attempt to fail with a foreign key constraint violation.

**CURRENT BROKEN FLOW:**
1. Student submits exam successfully ✅
2. Auto-scoring calculates correct scores ✅
3. Database insertion FAILS due to missing system user ❌
4. Retry mechanism also FAILS with same constraint violation ❌
5. Fallback check finds no results (because insert failed) ❌
6. Student gets "manual grading required" message despite auto-gradable questions ❌
7. Performance exceeds goal (2754ms vs 2000ms target) due to failed operations ❌

**ALL ISSUES TO FIX:**

1. **MISSING SYSTEM USER RECORD** (PRIMARY ISSUE)
   - The UUID '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001' must be inserted into the users table
   - This is the system user for auto-scoring operations
   - Without this, ALL auto-scoring fails

2. **BROKEN AUTO-SCORING PIPELINE**
   - Auto-scoring logic works correctly (calculates scores properly)
   - Database persistence fails due to foreign key constraint
   - No exam results are being saved despite successful scoring

3. **PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION**
   - Submission taking 2754ms (37% over 2-second goal)
   - Caused by failed database operations and retry attempts
   - Performance monitoring shows consistent goal failures

4. **POOR ERROR HANDLING**
   - Students see misleading "manual grading required" messages
   - Auto-gradable multiple choice questions appear to need manual review
   - No clear indication of system failure vs actual manual grading needs

5. **DATABASE SCHEMA INCONSISTENCY**
   - Migration snapshots show recorded_by field changed from text to uuid
   - System expects UUID type but hardcoded system user doesn't exist
   - Foreign key constraint prevents any auto-scoring operations

**IMPACT:**
- Students cannot get instant feedback on exams
- Auto-gradable questions appear broken
- Manual workload increases unnecessarily for teachers
- System performance degrades consistently
- User experience is severely impacted

**FILES AFFECTED:**
- server/routes.ts (autoScoreExamSession function)
- server/storage.ts (recordExamResult function)
- Database users table (missing system user record)
- migrations/schema.ts (shows foreign key constraint)

**SOLUTION NEEDED:**
Create the system user record with UUID '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001' in the users table to satisfy the foreign key constraint and restore auto-scoring functionality.

This is a blocking issue preventing the core exam functionality from working properly.
