📖 The Full THS Story Plan — Chapter 1 (Login, Roles & Provisioning)

Chapter 1: The Foundation — Roles, Login, and Provisioning

Treasure-Home School (THS) must begin with a secure, role-based authentication system. This is the backbone that guarantees each user — whether admin, teacher, student, or parent — accesses only what is meant for them. Without this, the exam lifecycle cannot function properly.


---

1. 🎭 Roles to Support

Every role is clearly separated, and permissions are carefully scoped:

Admin

Creates accounts for all roles (students, teachers, parents).

Manages classes, subjects, and teacher assignments.

Oversees exams, reports, and resets passwords if needed.


Teacher

Creates and schedules exams for assigned subjects.

Marks subjective questions (if manual review is required).

Reviews scores and provides remarks.

Monitors cheating alerts for their subject exams.


Student

Logs in to take exams within scheduled time.

Views personal scores and report cards.

Cannot see or edit other students’ data.


Parent

Logs in only to view their child’s performance.

Downloads report cards and exam summaries.

If linked to multiple children, can switch between them.

2. 🔐 Usernames & Passwords (THS-Branded Standard)

Every user account follows a Treasure-Home School branded convention to ensure uniqueness, order, and professionalism.

Student IDs:
Format → THS-STU-<YEAR>-<CLASS>-<ROLLNO>
Example → THS-STU-2025-PR3-001

Teacher IDs:
Format → THS-TCH-<YEAR>-<SUBJECT>-<ROLLNO>
Example → THS-TCH-2025-MTH-002

Parent IDs:
Format → THS-PAR-<YEAR>-<ROLLNO>
Example → THS-PAR-2025-001

Admin IDs:
Format → THS-ADM-<ROLE>
Example → THS-ADM-PRINCIPAL


Default Password Format:
THS@<YEAR>#<RANDOM>
Example → THS@2025#9X3M

On first login, must_change_password = true.

This forces users to set their own secure password immediately.



---

3. 🔗 Parent–Child Linking

Parent accounts are automatically tied to students when Admin enters student details.

One Parent → One Child (default)

One Parent → Multiple Children (if siblings attend THS)

Parent dashboard has a “Switch Child” dropdown.


Privacy Control: Parents never see other students’ data.


Data Model Example:

Parent ID: THS-PAR-2025-001
Parent Name: Mrs. Akinwale
Linked Students:
  - THS-STU-2025-PR3-001 (Tunde Akinwale, Primary 3)
  - THS-STU-2025-PR6-010 (Titi Akinwale, Primary 6)


---

4. 📧 Emails for Login (Teachers/Admins)

Students/Parents: Use THS-generated usernames (to avoid dependency on personal email).

Teachers/Admins: Can use real Google/Yahoo emails for login.

Example: teacher.jane@gmail.com or admin@treasurehomeschool.org.

This makes password recovery easier and keeps teacher/admin accounts professional.




---

5. 🔑 Forgot Password Flow

A forgot password system reduces admin workload and improves security.

1. Login Page: “Forgot Password?” link.


2. Recovery Options:

Teachers/Admins → Reset link sent to their email.

Students → Reset link sent to parent’s registered email.

Parents → Reset link sent to their own email.



3. Tokenized Link:

Expires in 15 minutes.

Allows secure password reset.



4. Admin Override:

Admin dashboard includes Reset Password option for emergencies.





---

6. 🛠 Provisioning Flow (How Accounts Are Created)

Step 1: Admin uploads CSV file (or enters manually).

Student Name | Class | Parent Name | Parent Email | Teacher | Subject

Step 2: System auto-generates THS usernames + passwords.

Step 3: Parent-child link established.

Step 4: Login slips generated (printable, with QR code optional).

Step 5: Accounts ready for login → dashboards open.



---

👉 By the end of Chapter 1, THS has:

All roles provisioned with usernames/passwords.

Parent-child links in place.

Login recovery options enabled.

A secure base ready for the exam lifecycle to begin.
