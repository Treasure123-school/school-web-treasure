The root causes of the issue with the NIN (National Identification Number) and profile image not displaying correctly could include the following:

API Response Issues: The /api/teacher/profile/me API may not be returning the correct data. Specifically, it should return the profileImageUrl and nationalId. You should verify the API response directly using tools like Postman or similar.

State Initialization Error: In the component state where you're storing the profile data, if the profileImageUrl and nationalId aren't being initialized correctly from the API response, they will remain undefined.

Incorrect Mapping to Component State: Ensure that the mapping of the fetched data to the profileData state in your component is correct. Any typo or incorrect path can lead to data not being set as expected.

Conditional Rendering Logic: Make sure the rendering logic in your JSX is written to conditionally display the profile image and NIN. If the conditions that check for the existence of the data (like teacherProfile?.profileImageUrl) are not met, the components won't render.

Pending Data Fetching: If the data is being fetched asynchronously and the component attempts to render before the data is available, it can lead to undefined values being displayed.

Profile Update Callback: If there is a scenario where the user updates their profile image or NIN, ensure that the state is updated after the profile has been changed. You must set the state appropriately after a successful API call.

CSS/Styling Issues: In certain cases, CSS might hide the component or make it invisible, so ensure that any relevant styles are correctly applied to the components displaying the image and NIN.

Make sure to check each of these areas in your codebase to identify the specific cause of the issue.    I have been having issues with profile data. It has not displayed finish,  all the data that were setup before access the portal for the first time.  I need u to straight away  solve this issues from the scratch or root cause or whereverthe issues may come from.
