Chapter 1: Foundation — Roles, Login & Access Control
Treasure-Home School begins with structure and security.
Every feature that follows depends on a strong authentication and verification base.
1. Defined Roles
• Admin: Central authority. Manages classes, subjects, teachers, exams, and verifications.
• Teacher: Creates exams, grades theory (or reviews AI scores), views performance.
• Student: Takes tests and exams; views scores and feedback.
• Parent: Linked to children; monitors academic progress and downloads reports.
2. Login Architecture
Google Sign-In (Teachers & Admins)
• Uses Google OAuth2 for real identity verification.
• When a teacher or admin signs in the first time, the system checks if their email is verified in the Admin Portal. 
• ✅ If verified → grant dashboard access.
• 🚫 If not verified → show friendly message: 
“Your account is awaiting Admin approval. You’ll be notified once verified.”
This replaces the confusing ‘Sign failed’ message.
THS ID Login (Students & Parents)
• Students and parents use system-generated IDs: 
• Student → THS-STU-2025-PR3-001
• Parent → THS-PAR-2025-001
• Default password format: THS@2025#A9M4
• Must change password on first login.
Each role lands on their respective dashboard with appropriate permissions.
3. Admin User Controls
Inside the Admin Portal, each account (Teacher, Student, Parent) has management tools:
ActionDescriptionVerify / UnverifyActivate or deactivate staff/student accounts.Suspend / UnsuspendTemporarily block access for misconduct or review.Reset PasswordGenerate a secure new password for any user.Change Recovery EmailUpdate recovery email address if lost or incorrect.Delete AccountSafely remove an account while preserving related exam data.LogsView all user activities and login history. 
Messages to users must be clear:
“Account suspended. Please contact the Admin.”
“Account verification pending. Await Admin approval.”
No vague “failed” messages — only professional and contextual feedback.
4. Parent–Child Linking
• During import or registration, each student record links to a parent account (via parent email or ID).
• A parent with multiple children sees a “Switch Child” dropdown.
• Parents cannot see other students’ data.
5. Recovery & Password Reset
Students/Parents
• Click “Forgot Password” → enter username or registered email.
• Receive reset link (expires in 15 mins).
• Must use strong new password.
• System logs recovery attempts (max 3/hour).
Admin Recovery Powers
• Can reset user passwords, edit recovery emails, or re-verify accounts.
• Maintains super-admin account (recovery@ths.edu.ng) for last-resort recovery.
✅ End of Chapter 1:
All users can sign in securely, Google-linked roles are verified, and the admin has full oversight.
