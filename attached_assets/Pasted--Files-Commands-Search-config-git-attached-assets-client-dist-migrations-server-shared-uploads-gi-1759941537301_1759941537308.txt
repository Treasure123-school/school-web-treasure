Teacher Profile Creation - Complete Issue Analysis
Based on the error message "Profile Creation Failed - Failed to fetch" and reviewing the codebase, here are ALL the issues preventing teacher profile creation:

üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES
1. Database Connection/Query Failure
What's Happening:

The error "Failed to fetch" indicates the backend API call is failing
Based on the diagnostic reports, this is likely caused by database query errors
Root Causes:

Missing or incomplete teacher_profiles table schema
Database connection pool exhaustion (max=20, could be saturated)
Query timeout due to slow database response
2. File Upload Handling Issues
What's Happening:

Profile photo (1000031842.jpg) is being uploaded
FormData submission may be failing due to file size or format validation
Potential Problems:

File size exceeds 5MB limit (check actual file size)
Multer middleware rejecting upload
File path not being saved correctly to database
CORS issues with file upload
3. Backend Validation Failures
What's Happening:

The profile submission endpoint (/api/teacher/profile/setup) may be rejecting the data
Potential Issues:

Staff ID uniqueness constraint - If staffId is empty or duplicate, insertion fails
Missing required fields not caught by frontend validation
JSON parsing errors for subjects/classes arrays
Foreign key constraint violations (user_id not found in users table)
4. Authentication/Authorization Issues
What's Happening:

User may not have proper authentication token
Session might have expired
Check:

JWT token is valid and present in request headers
User roleId is correctly set to Teacher (roleId = 2)
User status is "active" (not pending/suspended)
5. API Route Handler Errors
Location:  line ~835-900

Potential Problems:

Try-catch block not catching all errors
Response not sending proper error messages
Async/await issues causing unhandled promise rejections
Database transaction not rolling back on error
6. Frontend Form Submission Issues
Location:  line ~114-131

Problems:

Mutation error not being handled properly
FormData construction missing required fields
Network request timeout (default 30s may be exceeded)
CORS preflight failing
7. Database Schema Mismatch
What's Happening:

The teacher_profiles table may exist but have incorrect column types or constraints
Specific Issues:

staff_id column has UNIQUE constraint causing conflicts
subjects or assigned_classes columns not accepting empty arrays
user_id foreign key constraint failing
Missing default values for optional fields
8. Server Resource Exhaustion
Evidence from logs:

üóÑÔ∏è Connected to PostgreSQL version: 17.6
üìä Connection Pool: max=20, idle_timeout=300s
Potential Issues:

All 20 database connections in use
Background services (auto-publish, cleanup) holding connections
Slow queries blocking connection pool
Memory limits reached during file upload
9. CORS/Network Issues
What's Happening:

Browser blocking fetch request due to CORS policy
Network instability causing request failures
Check:

Server CORS configuration allows multipart/form-data
File upload MIME types are whitelisted
Request size within server limits
10. Vite Connection Instability
Evidence from earlier logs:

[vite] server connection lost. Polling for restart...
Impact:

Frontend hot reload interrupted during submission
API proxy failing to forward requests
WebSocket connection dropping
üü° WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT
Step 1: Identify Exact Error

üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
Check Backend Console - Look for detailed error messages after applying logging fix
Verify Database Connection - Ensure teacher_profiles table exists and is accessible
Test File Upload Separately - Try uploading profile photo without form submission
Check Network Tab - See exact HTTP status code and response payload
Verify Authentication - Confirm user is properly authenticated with valid JWT
üìä DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST
After submitting the form again, check:

 Backend console shows detailed error with stack trace
 HTTP status code (500, 400, 401, 403, 413, etc.)
 Database query logs show actual SQL error
 File upload succeeds (uploads folder contains new file)
 FormData contains all required fields
 User authentication is valid
Apply the logging fixes above first, then try submitting the profile again. The enhanced error messages will pinpoint the exact failure cause.
