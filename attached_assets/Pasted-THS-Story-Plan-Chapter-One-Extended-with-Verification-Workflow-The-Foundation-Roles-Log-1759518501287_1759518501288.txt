THS Story Plan — Chapter One (Extended with Verification Workflow)


---

The Foundation: Roles, Login & Provisioning

Treasure-Home School (THS) begins with a rock-solid authentication and approval system. The aim is to balance security, professionalism, and smooth user experience so that no one “slips” into the wrong dashboard.


---

1. Roles & Access Control

Admin: Master controller. Creates and approves accounts, assigns teachers, suspends/un-suspends users, manages school structure.

Teacher: Logs in with their real Google email but must first be approved by Admin. Can create/manage exams, mark essays, and view class reports.

Student: Logs in with THS-branded username + password. Can take exams and view results.

Parent: Logs in with THS-branded username + password. Can only view/download their child’s results.



---

2. Usernames & Passwords

Students/Parents:

Pre-generated by Admin during bulk import.

Format:

Student: THS-STU-2025-PR3-001

Parent: THS-PAR-2025-001


Default password: THS@2025#AB12 (must change on first login).


Teachers/Admins:

Must use their real Google emails (no random emails).

Login requires Admin approval before access is granted.




---

3. Parent–Child Linking

Each student is linked to one or more parent accounts during bulk import.

If a parent has multiple children, they see a child selector in their dashboard.

Parents only ever see their child’s data — no cross-student access allowed.



---

4. Login Flows (Per Role)

Students & Parents

Enter username + password → system checks DB.

If Active → straight to dashboard.

If Suspended → show message:

> “Your account is currently suspended. Please contact your class teacher or admin.”




Teachers & Admins (Google Sign-In)

1. Teacher/Admin clicks “Sign in with Google.”


2. System checks if Google email exists in DB:

If status = Active → direct to dashboard.

If status = Pending → block login, show message:

> “Welcome to THS Portal. Your account is awaiting Admin approval. You will be notified once verified.”



If email not found → create DB record with status = Pending. Show same pending message.

If status = Suspended → block login, show message:

> “Access denied: Your account is suspended by THS Admin.”







---

5. Admin Portal — User Management

Admin has full control:

Approve (Verify): Pending user becomes Active.

Suspend: Blocks a user temporarily.

Unsuspend: Restores access.

Unverify: Moves a user back to Pending.


Status values in DB:

Active → Full access.

Pending → Awaiting Admin approval.

Suspended → Temporarily blocked.



---

6. Professional Messaging

The system must never show raw “login failed.” Instead:

Pending → “Your email is registered but awaiting approval. Contact Admin.”

Suspended → “Your account is suspended. Contact Admin.”

Wrong credentials → “Invalid login. Please check your details and try again.”


This maintains professional trust and avoids confusion.


---

7. Notification System

When a new Pending Teacher/Admin appears → Admin receives an alert.

When Admin approves → Teacher/Admin receives an email confirmation:

> “Your Treasure-Home School account has been verified. You can now access your dashboard.”





---

8. Provisioning Flow Recap

1. Admin bulk-imports Students + Parents → system auto-generates usernames/passwords.


2. Teachers/Admins sign in via Google → system creates Pending records.


3. Admin reviews pending list → Approves or Suspends.


4. Users see clear branded messages every step of the way.



👉 At the end of this chapter, everyone has a login pathway, but security is guaranteed. No one gets access to Admin/Teacher dashboards without explicit approval.
