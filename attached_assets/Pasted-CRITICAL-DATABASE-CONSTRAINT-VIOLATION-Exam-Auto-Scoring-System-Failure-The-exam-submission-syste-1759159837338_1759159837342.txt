CRITICAL DATABASE CONSTRAINT VIOLATION - Exam Auto-Scoring System Failure

The exam submission system is failing due to a foreign key constraint violation in the exam_results table. Here's the specific issue and context:

ERROR DETAILS:
- PostgresError: insert or update on table "exam_results" violates foreign key constraint "exam_results_recorded_by_fkey"
- Detail: Key (recorded_by)=(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001) is not present in table "users"
- The auto-scoring system tries to use a hardcoded UUID '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001' for the recorded_by field, but this UUID doesn't exist in the users table

ROOT CAUSE:
The auto-scoring function in server/routes.ts uses a hardcoded system UUID (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001) to indicate auto-generated results, but this UUID was never inserted into the users table, causing the foreign key constraint to fail.

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
1. Student submits exam successfully 
2. Auto-scoring begins and calculates correct scores
3. Database insertion fails due to missing system user record
4. Retry mechanism also fails with same constraint violation
5. Student sees "manual grading required" message despite having auto-gradable questions
6. Performance exceeds 2-second goal (2754ms) due to failed database operations

REMAINING ISSUES TO SOLVE:

1. **Create System User Record**: Insert the system UUID '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001' into the users table with appropriate role/details for auto-scoring operations

2. **Fix Auto-Scoring Pipeline**: Ensure the auto-scoring system can successfully save results to exam_results table without constraint violations

3. **Performance Optimization**: The submission pipeline is taking 2754ms (exceeding 2-second goal) - likely due to failed database operations and retry attempts

4. **Fallback Mechanism**: Improve error handling when auto-scoring fails to provide better user feedback

5. **Database Schema Validation**: Ensure all foreign key relationships are properly satisfied for automated operations

The system has comprehensive auto-scoring logic that correctly calculates scores, but fails at the final database persistence step due to this constraint violation. Students are experiencing degraded functionality where auto-gradable questions appear to require manual grading.

Files involved:
- server/routes.ts (autoScoreExamSession function)
- server/storage.ts (recordExamResult function) 
- Database schema (users and exam_results tables)

Please fix the constraint violation and ensure the auto-scoring system can persist results successfully.
