THS Story Plan — Chapter One (Extended: Password Recovery & Admin Recovery)
Page 11 – The Human Side of Passwords
No matter how carefully users are trained, students forget, parents lose slips, and even teachers misplace credentials.
That’s why THS must implement a “Forget Password” and “Admin Recovery” mechanism.
1. Forget Password (Students & Parents)
• On login screen → link: “Forgot Password?”
• Flow: 
• User enters username or email.
• System checks if it exists.
• If valid → sends reset link to registered parent/teacher email. 
• Email: 
📧 “Hello, you requested a password reset for THS Portal. Click the link below to set a new password. This link expires in 15 minutes.”
• User clicks link → taken to secure reset form.
• System enforces strong password rules: 
• At least 8 characters
• Mix of upper/lowercase, numbers, and symbols
• New password replaces old one → audit log entry created.
⚠️ Security Check:
• Limit reset attempts (e.g., max 3 per hour) to prevent abuse.
• Link expires quickly.
2. Forget Password (Teachers & Admins via Google Sign-In)
Since Teachers/Admins log in with Google, they don’t need password reset inside THS.
• If they can’t access their Google account → recovery is handled via Google itself.
• But inside THS, if a teacher’s account is suspended or unverified, message clearly states: 
🔒 “Your account is inactive. Please contact Admin.”
3. Admin Recovery Powers
The Admin must be equipped with extra tools:
a) Reset Student/Parent Passwords
• From the Admin dashboard: 
• Click user → “Reset Password” → generates a random secure password.
• Option: “Require password change at next login.”
b) Change Recovery Email
• Each account has a Recovery Email field.
• Students/Parents → parent’s email.
• Teachers → their Google email.
• Admin can update it if wrong/lost.
• Log entry always records “Recovery email updated by Admin.”
c) Master Recovery Account
• THS should have one super-admin email (e.g., recovery@ths.edu.ng).
• This is stored securely in the system, only used for: 
• Restoring lost Admin accounts
• Resetting the entire system’s Admin login
• This ensures that no one can permanently lock the Admin out.
4. Professional Safeguards
• Audit Logs: Every reset, recovery, or email change is logged.
• Notifications: When recovery is done, send an alert email to the account holder: 
⚠️ “Your password was reset on THS Portal by Admin. If this wasn’t you, contact the school immediately.”
• Suspicious Activity Lock: If too many failed recovery attempts happen, system temporarily locks the account.

Without recovery:
• Students would flood Admin with “I forgot” issues.
• Parents would get frustrated and lose trust.
• Admin could be permanently locked out if something goes wrong.
With recovery:
• Smooth self-service for Students/Parents.
• Secure oversight for Admin.
• Strong safety net with a Master Recovery Account.
✅ Update Recap for Chapter One:
• Added Forget Password Flow for Students/Parents (reset link by email).
• Teachers/Admins rely on Google recovery.
• Admin recovery powers: reset user passwords, change recovery emails, restore locked accounts.
• Added Master Recovery Account (super admin fallback).
• Security layers: audit logs, notifications, rate-limiting, suspicious activity lock.
