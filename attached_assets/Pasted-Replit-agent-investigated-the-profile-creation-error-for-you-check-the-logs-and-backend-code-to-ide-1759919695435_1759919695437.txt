WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED (in priority order):
Add getAllTeacherProfiles() method to server/storage.ts and IStorage interface

Fix relatedEntityId type - convert to string: relatedEntityId: profile.id.toString()
Add autoGradeTheoryQuestions field to teacher profile schema
Add getAISuggestedGradingTasks() method to storage or remove the endpoint
