# Treasure-Home School Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive school management portal for Treasure-Home School, built as a full-stack web application. The system provides role-based dashboards for students, teachers, administrators, and parents, along with a public-facing website. It manages core school operations including student enrollment, attendance tracking, grade management, announcements, and communication between stakeholders.

The application follows a modern monorepo architecture with shared schema definitions and implements a complete authentication system with role-based access control. The system is designed to handle multiple user types with distinct permissions and interfaces tailored to their specific needs.

### September 27, 2025 - Critical Exam Scoring Display Fix
- üêõ **Issue Identified**: Students were seeing "Manual grading will be performed" instead of their actual exam scores
- üîç **Root Cause**: Field name mismatch between frontend and backend - frontend expected `data.result.score` but backend was sending `data.result.totalScore`
- ‚ö° **Solution Implemented**: Updated both response paths in `server/routes.ts` submit endpoint:
  - Main success path now sends both `score` and `totalScore` fields for compatibility
  - Rescue/fallback path also fixed with same dual-field pattern
  - Cleaned up duplicate auto-scoring functions to avoid confusion
- ‚úÖ **Technical Details**: Backend was calculating scores correctly but frontend couldn't read them due to field name mismatch
- ‚úÖ **Architect Reviewed**: Changes confirmed to be correct, comprehensive, and secure with no impact on other functionality
- üìä **Impact**: Students now see their automatic exam scores immediately after submission - the scoring system was already working, just the display was broken
