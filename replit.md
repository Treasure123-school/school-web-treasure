# Treasure-Home School Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive school management portal for Treasure-Home School, built as a full-stack web application. The system provides role-based dashboards for students, teachers, administrators, and parents, along with a public-facing website. It manages core school operations including student enrollment, attendance tracking, grade management, announcements, and communication between stakeholders.

The application follows a modern monorepo architecture with shared schema definitions and implements a complete authentication system with role-based access control. The system is designed to handle multiple user types with distinct permissions and interfaces tailored to their specific needs.
