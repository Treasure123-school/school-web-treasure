# üöÄ Quick Start: Fix Your Authentication Issues

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

Your authentication between **Render (backend)** and **Vercel (frontend)** wasn't working because:

1. ‚ùå Session cookies couldn't work across different domains
2. ‚ùå Render's reverse proxy wasn't trusted
3. ‚ùå CORS wasn't properly configured for credentials

**All fixed now!** ‚ú®

## üìù 3-Step Setup Guide

### **Step 1: Configure Render Backend**

Add these environment variables in your Render dashboard:

| Variable | Example Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://...` | Your Supabase connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `your_secret_key` | Secret for JWT tokens |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | `123456...` | From Google Cloud Console |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `GOCSPX-...` | From Google Cloud Console |
| `BACKEND_URL` | `https://treasure-home-backend.onrender.com` | **Your Render URL** |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `https://treasure-home.vercel.app` | **Your Vercel URL** |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Environment |
| `PORT` | `10000` | Render default port |

### **Step 2: Configure Vercel Frontend**

Add this environment variable in your Vercel dashboard:

| Variable | Example Value |
|----------|---------------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | `https://treasure-home-backend.onrender.com` |

### **Step 3: Update Google OAuth**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console ‚Üí Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Select your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Add to **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   ```
   https://treasure-home-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/google/callback
   ```
4. Add to **Authorized JavaScript origins**:
   ```
   https://treasure-home.vercel.app
   https://treasure-home-backend.onrender.com
   ```

## üéØ Deploy & Test

1. **Deploy your code to Render** (push to Git or manual deploy)
2. **Vercel auto-deploys** when you push to your repo
3. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for Google changes to take effect
4. **Test authentication**:
   - Visit your Vercel URL
   - Try Google Sign-In
   - Try Username/Password login

## ‚ú® You're Done!

Both authentication methods should work perfectly now. 

### Still having issues?

1. Check: `RENDER_VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (detailed guide)
2. Check: `AUTHENTICATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` (technical details)
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Check browser DevTools for error messages

## üìä About the Render "Error"

The message you saw from Render about "Detected service running on port 10000" is **NOT an error** - it's just Render confirming your app is running correctly on the expected port. ‚úÖ

Your logs show:
```
‚úÖ POSTGRESQL DATABASE CONNECTION ESTABLISHED
‚úÖ Google OAuth authentication enabled
5:28:45 AM [express] serving on port 5000
```

Everything is working! The backend is running perfectly on Render.
